# Condition

Learn how to use if, else if, and else to make decisions based on conditions. Practice comparing values and controlling program flow. Also, learn the switch statement for handling multiple choices more easily.

### üü¢ Beginner (Easy) ‚Äì Basic Conditions and Operators

  * **Check Age for Eligibility:** Determine if a person is eligible to vote based on age.
  * [See Solution](../check_age_eligibility.c)

  * **Identify Positive, Negative or Zero:** Prompt user to enter a number and determine if it is positive, negative, or zero.
    * [See Solution](../identify_number.c)

  * **Identify Even or Odd Number:** Ask user to enter an integer and determine if it is even or odd.
    * [See Solution](../conditions_even_odd.c)

  * **Compare Two Integers:** Prompt user to enter two integers and determine if they are equal or which one is bigger.
    * [See Solution](../conditions_compare_integers.c)

  * **Day of the Week by Number:** User inputs a number (1-7) and program prints the corresponding day of the week.
    * [See Solution](../conditions_day_of_week.c)

  * **Month Name Using Switch Statement:** Ask the user to enter a number between 1 and 12. Use a switch statement to print the corresponding full month name.
    * [See Solution](../switch_month_name.c)

  * **Deliver a message based on temperature input:** Write a program that asks the user to input the temperature (in degrees Celsius). Based on the input temperature, the program displays an appropriate message about the weather.
    * [See Solution](../temperature_message.c)

### üü° Intermediate (Medium) ‚Äì Multiple Conditions and Comparisons

  * **Sum with Special Condition:** Write a program to sum two integers. If the sum is between 15 and 20, it will return 20.
    * [See Solution](../conditions_sum_special.c)

  * **Largest of Three Numbers:** Ask the user to enter three integers and print the largest one.
    * [See Solution](../largest_three_numbers.c)

  * **Identify Leap Years:** Determine if a given year is a leap year based on leap year rules. *A leap year has 366 days, with February having 29 days. It occurs when the year is divisible by 4, except for years divisible by 100, unless they are also divisible by 400.*
    * [See Solution](../identify_leap_year.c)

  * **Compare Ages by Date of Birth:** Write a program that asks the user to input the date of birth for two persons in the format year/month/day. The program should then compare these two dates and print which person is the youngest. If both persons have the same birth date, print a message indicating they are the same age.
      * Input format example: 1990/12/25.
      * Output should be one of the following messages:
        * ‚ÄúThe first person is the youngest‚Äù
        * ‚ÄúThe second person is the youngest‚Äù
        * ‚ÄúBoth persons have the same age‚Äù
    * [See Solution](../compare_ages.c)

### üî¥ Advanced (Hard) ‚Äì Math & Conditions Combined

  * **Quadratic Equation Roots:** Ask the user to enter constants a, b, and c, then calculate and print the roots of ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
    * [See Solution](../quadratic_equation_roots.c)

  * **Identify a Prime Number:** Write a program to check if a number entered by the user is prime.
    * [See Solution](../identify_prime_number.c)
