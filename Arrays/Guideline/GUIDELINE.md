# Arrays

Learn how to use arrays to store multiple values in a single variable. Practice accessing, modifying, and looping through array elements to manipulate data efficiently. Also, explore multidimensional arrays for handling more complex data structures.

### ðŸŸ¢ Beginner (Easy) â€“ Basic arrays and Simple loops

  * **Print Each Character of a String:** Print each character of the string "CADT" one by one.
    * [See Solution](../print_chars.c)

  * **Print a string stored in a character array:** Declare a character array to store a string and print the string.
    * [See Solution](../string_print.c)

  * **Print Elements of an Integer Array:** Write a program to declare and initialize an integer array of size 5, then use a loop to print all its elements.
    * [See Solution](../array_print_elements.c)

  * **Sum of Elements in an Integer Array:** Create a program that calculates the sum of all elements in an integer array of size 7.
    * [See Solution](../array_sum_elements.c)

  * **Find Maximum Value in Array:** Declare an array of integers and initialize it. Find and print the maximum value in the array.
    * [See Solution](../array_max.c)

  * **Copy Contents from One Array to Another:** Write a program to copy the contents of one integer array into another array of the same size.
    * [See Solution](../array_copy.c)

  * **Fruit Names Array:** Declare a string array to store names of fruits and print each fruit name on a new line.
    * [See Solution](../arrays_fruit_names.c)

  * **Calculate Average of Array Elements:** Declare an array of integers and initialize it. Calculate and print the average of all elements.
    * [See Solution](../array_average.c)

  * **Concatenate First Name and Last Name:** Combine firstname and lastname with a space in between, then print the full name.
    * [See Solution](../arrays_concatenate.c)

  * **3x3 Matrix Initialization and Printing:** Initialize a 3x3 integer matrix and print its elements in a grid format.
    * [See Solution](../arrays_matrix.c)

### ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate (Medium) â€“ String manipulation and Moderate logic

  * **Sum and Subtract Corresponding Elements of Two Arrays with Input Validation:** Write a C function that takes two arrays of integers and their size, then returns a new array where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the input arrays.
    * [See Solution](../array_sum.c)

  * **Find Average and Display Scores Above Average:** Write a program to ask a user for 10 scores, calculate the average, and display the scores that are greater than the average.
    * [See Solution](../average_scores.c)

  * **Check if a Number Exists in an Array:** Given an array of 9 integers, write a program that tests if a user input number exists in the array.
    * [See Solution](../check_number_in_array.c)

  * **Sum Student Scores Using Arrays:** Use an array to store student scores and then calculate the total of the student's scores.
    * [See Solution](../sum_student_scores.c)

  * **Find Largest and Smallest Number in an Array:** Use an array to store user input (limit 20 numbers) and find the largest and smallest number in the array.
    * [See Solution](../find_largest_smallest.c)

### ðŸ”´ Advanced (Hard) â€“ Complex logic and Careful condition handling

  * **Convert 8-bit Binary Number to Decimal:** Convert an 8-bit binary number to decimal
    * [See Solution](../binary_to_decimal.c)

  * **Convert a Decimal Number to Binary (8-bit):** Convert a decimal number to binary (8-bit representation).
    * [See Solution](../decimal_to_binary.c)

  * **Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies:** Given an array candies representing candies each kid has, and extraCandies, determine for each kid if giving all extraCandies makes them have the greatest number.
    * [See Solution](../kids_greatest_candies.c)

  * **Matrix Operations: Sum, Subtract, Multiply:** Write an algorithm that takes two 2D integer arrays (matrices) and their dimensions, then prints new matrices for their sum, difference, and multiplication.
    * [See Solution](../matrix_operations.c)
