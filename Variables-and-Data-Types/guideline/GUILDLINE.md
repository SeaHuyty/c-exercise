# Variables And Data Types

Learn how to declare variables, assign values, and print different data types in C. Practice simple calculations and user input handling to build a strong foundation in working with variables.

### ðŸŸ¢ Beginner (Easy) â€“ Basic Variables and Data Types

  * **Declare and Print a Character:** Declare a char variable with value 'X' and print it.
    * [See Solution](../declare_print_char.c)

  * **Declare and Print a Float:** Declare a float variable with value 3.14159 and print it.
    * [See Solution](../declare_print_float.c)

  * **Declare and Print an Integer:** Declare an int variable with value 5 and print it.
    * [See Solution](../declare_print_integer.c)

  * **Declare and Print Two Integers** Declare two integer variables, assign values 10 and 20 respectively. Print both integer value.
    * [See Solution](../declare_print_integer2.c)

  * **Declare Two Integers and Calculate Sum:** Declare two integer variables and calculate the sum of them.
    * [See Solution](../sum_two_integers.c)

  * **Declare and Print City Data:** Declare a double variable temperature with value 24.5, a char variable Amsterdam with value 'A', and an int variable population with value 1000000. Then print all three.
    * [See Solution](../declare_city_data.c)

  * **Declare and Print Multiple Data Types:** Declare a float variable gpa with value 3.75, a char variable level with value 'S', and an int variable course with value 5. Then print all three.
    * [See Solution](../declare_multiple_types.c)

  * **Declare and Print Multiple Variable Types:** Declare an int variable age with value 25, a float variable height with value 2.35, and a char variable firstInitial with value 'S'. Then print:
  ```
    My name is S, and I'm 25 years old
    I'm 2.35 meters tall.
  ```
    * [See Solution](../declare_print_variables.c)

### ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate (Medium) â€“ Calculations and User Input

  * **Divide Two Float Numbers:** Declare two float variables phi (3.14) and k (4.13), divide phi by k, and print the result.
    * [See Solution](../divide_two_floats.c)

  * **User Input and Output:** Prompt the user to enter their name and age, then print the entered name and age.
    * [See Solution](../user_input_output.c)

### ðŸ”´ Advanced (Hard) â€“ Advanced Input and Time Calculations

  * **Time Conversion (hh:mm:ss to seconds):** Prompt the user to enter hours, minutes, and seconds, then convert the total time to seconds and print the result.
    * [See Solution](../time_conversion.c)

  * **Time Conversion (seconds to hh:mm:ss):** Prompt the user to enter a number of seconds, then convert and print it as hours, minutes, and seconds.
    * [See Solution](../time_converter_seconds_to_hms.c)
