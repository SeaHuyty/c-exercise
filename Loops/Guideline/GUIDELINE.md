# Loops

Learn how to use loops in C to repeat actions efficiently. Practice using while and for loops to handle repeated tasks, process user input, and control program flow based on conditions. This builds a solid understanding of iteration and logic.

### 🟢 Beginner (Easy) – Loops and Repetition

  * **Star Pattern:** Construct the below pattern of stars using nested for loops.

    * [See Solution](../star_pattern.c)

  * **Sum From 1 to N:** Let user enter a positive integer and calculate the total sum from 1 to that number.
    * [See Solution](../sum_1_to_n.c)

  * **Count Positive Numbers Until Negative is Entered:** Ask the user to enter numbers. Keep accepting input using a while loop. Stop when a negative number is entered. Then print how many positive numbers were entered.
    * [See Solution](../while_positive_counter.c)

  * **Even Number Filter:** Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to enter a number, prints it only if it's even, skips odd numbers, and stops when the user enters a number less than or equal to zero.
    * [See Solution](../break_continue_while.c)

  * **Multiplication Table with Input Validation:** Ask the user to enter a positive number. If the number is not positive, ask again. When a valid number is entered, print its multiplication table from 1 to 10.
    * [See Solution](../multiplication_table_input_validation.c)

### 🟡 Intermediate (Medium) – Logical Conditions and Number Patterns

  * **Numbers Divisible by 7 but Not by 5:** Write a program to print all the numbers between 1000 and 2000 which are divisible by 7 but not a multiple of 5.
    * [See Solution](../divisible_by_7_not_5.c)

  * **FizzBuzz:** Print numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print “Fizz” for multiples of 5, print “Buzz” and for multiples of both, print “FizzBuzz”.
    * [See Solution](../fizzbuzz.c)

  * **Prime Numbers:** Display prime numbers between 3 and 45.
    * [See Solution](../prime_numbers.c)

### 🔴 Advanced (Hard) – Math Logic and Recursion Practice

  * **Factorial Calculator:** Write a program to calculate factorial of a number.
    * [See Solution](../factorial_calculator.c)
